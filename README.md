2. **Launch the application** - it will automatically scan for connected devices
3. **Select your device** from the dropdown menu if not already selected

### Managing Pairing Files

The application can generate and manage pairing files for various applications:

1. **Load existing pairing file**: Click `Load` to import from your computer (recommended)
2. **Generate new pairing file**: Click `Generate` to create a fresh pairing
3. **Save pairing file**: Export the pairing file to your computer or your supported applications
4. **Validate pairing**: Test the pairing file against a local network-connected device

## Pairing Guide

### Prerequisites for Pairing

Before creating a pairing file, ensure you have:

1. **Set a passcode** on your iOS device

(For maximum performance, you should also)

2. **Sideload an app** (can be done with [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/) or a certificate + signer)

3. **Enable Developer Mode** on your iOS/iPadOS device (found in Settings â†’ Privacy & Security after sideloading an app)

3. **Load pairing file**: 
   - Ensure your device is unlocked and on the home screen
   - Click `Load`
   - If prompted on your device, tap `Trust` and enter your passcode
4. **Install for your app**:
   - Keep your device unlocked and on the home screen
   - Scroll down and click `Install` under your target application (e.g., "StikDebug")
   - You should see `Success` appear in green

## Supported Applications

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Detected
- Ensure your iOS device is connected via USB
- Check that the device is trusted on your computer
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the device

### Pairing File Issues
- Ensure developer mode is enabled on your iOS device
- Verify the pairing file format matches your target application (.plist or .mobiledevicepairing)
- Try creating a fresh pairing file using the `load` button if it doesn't function as expected
  
### Wireless Connection Issues
- Verify both devices are on the same network
- Check firewall settings that might block port 62078
